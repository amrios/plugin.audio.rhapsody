plugin.audio.rhapsody
=====================
NOTICE: The original project seems active now and works with Kodi 19, so I am no longer maintaining this fork for basic functionality.

Rhapsody and Napster plugin for Kodi

Requirements
------------
* Kodi v19 (Matrix)
* xbmcswift2

Features
-------- 
* My Music: Artists, Albums, Tracks, Favorites, Playlists
* Radio stations and artist radios
* Manage playlists
* Search
* Top artists, albums, tracks, genres, new releases
* Staff picks, recommendations, playlists
* Listening history, user charts


Manual Setup
------------
* Download the current release as a zip file
* Install the add-on with the add zip file option inside add-on settings


Notes
------------
* Kodiswift2 has been hacked up to support Python 3 "well enough" to support this plugin.
* Gapless playback is only possible on MP3 128 kBit/s quality. This is probably a Kodi limitation.
